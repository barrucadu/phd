\part{Literature Review}
\label{sec:litrev}

% "give a thorough account of previous and current work in the field,
% with ample citations of relevant literature; assess the current
% state of the field, for example, discuss assumptions generally made
% and their validity, limitations generally accepted and their
% necessity, major open problems and prospects for their solution and
% the relative strengths and weaknesses of the major lines of work
% pursued to date."

\todo{Overview of chapter. Explanation of concurrency in
  Haskell (monadic concurrency, io). Why nondeterministic concurrency
  is tricky.}

\section{Systematic Concurrency Testing}
\label{sec:litrev-sct}

\todo{Why we can't just unit test concurrent
  programs. Heisenbugs. What is SCT. How it solves the problem.}

\subsection{Implementation of SCT}
\label{sec:litrev-sct-impl}

\todo{How it's implemented in terms of primitive operations. The
  problem of computing schedules, and the systematic/random
  approaches. PULSE as an example.}

\subsection{Schedule Bounding}
\label{sec:litrev-sct-sched}

\todo{Discuss the various types of schedule bounding, with a focus on
  pre-emption and delay bounding. Enumerate pros/cons of each and
  suggest where each may do better than the other.}

\subsection{Tools}
\label{sec:litrev-sct-tools}

\todo{Major tools for SCT, and what languages they support.}

\subsection{Open Problems}
\label{sec:litrev-sct-probs}

\todo{``major open problems and prospects for their solution and the
  relative strengths and weaknesses of the major lines of work pursued
  to date.''}

\section{Deterministic Concurrency}
\label{sec:litrev-det}

\todo{Communication is the source of all concurrency
  nondeterminism. Shared state is an example of communication, as is
  message passing. Communication must be limited. This makes
  deterministic concurrency more limited than nondeterministic
  concurrency.}

\subsection{Evaluation Strategies}
\label{sec:litrev-det-strats}

\todo{Overview of Strategies. Limitations, use-cases.}

\subsection{The Par Monad}
\label{sec:litrev-det-par}

\todo{Overview of Par. Strengths wrt Strategies. Limitations,
  use-cases.}

\subsection{LVish}
\label{sec:litrev-det-lvish}

\todo{Overview of LVish. Strengths wrt Par. Limitations, use-cases.}

\subsection{State Revisions}
\label{sec:litref-det-revs}

\todo{Overview of state revisions. Strengths wrt
  Strategies. Comparison with par/lvish. Limitations, use-cases.}

\subsection{Open Problems}
\label{sec:litrev-det-probs}

\todo{``major open problems and prospects for their solution and the
  relative strengths and weaknesses of the major lines of work pursued
  to date.''}

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:litrev-sum}

\todo{Summarise prior sections. Why can't always use deterministic
  concurrency. Using SCT to test deterministic impls. What must be
  kept in mind when reading the following chapters.}
