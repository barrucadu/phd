Writing correct concurrent programs is very difficult, even for
experienced programmers. Traditional testing methodologies fail to
produce reliable results due to the nondeterminism inherent in the
scheduling of multiple threads. Therefore, different testing and
verification techniques are needed, to explicitly account for this new
source of nondeterminism.

This report introduces nondeterministic concurrency in a particular
setting: that of pure functional programming languages, which we shall
see has received little attention so far.

Literature on concurrency in a pure functional language is surveyed,
with multiple solutions to the problem considered. Initial results of
a library implementing systematic concurrency testing (SCT) for
Haskell, and of a library for deterministically parallelising
generate-and-test computations, are discussed.

A research proposal is formed, based on the literature review and the
preliminary results. The proposal outlines the goals and aims, and
presents a strategy for reaching them.
