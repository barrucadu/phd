\chapstart Testing concurrent programs cannot be done with conventional
techniques.  The nondeterminism of scheduling means that a test may produce
different results in different executions.  In this chapter we give an
introduction to \emph{systematic} concurrency testing, which addresses this
problem.  We first give a high-level overview~\sref{sct-fundamentals}, then have
a more detailed discussion of specific implementation
approaches~(\S\ref{sec:sct-complete}~and~\S\ref{sec:sct-incomplete}).
