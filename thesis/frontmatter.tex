% octavo disables the "ugly" table-of-contents dots, but I find they
% improve readability.  The default dot separation is 4.5, but I like
% 7:

This work has not previously been presented for an award at this, or
any other, university.  All sources are cited in the main text and
listed in the bibliography.  Earlier versions of parts of this thesis
were published in the following papers:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Michael Walker and Colin Runciman. \dejafu{}: A Concurrency
  Testing Library for Haskell.  In \emph{Proceedings of the 8th ACM
    SIGPLAN Symposium on Haskell}, Haskell 2015, pages 141--152.  ACM,
  2015.\nocite{walker2015}
\item \todo{CoCo paper}
\end{enumerate}

These papers were conceived, implemented, and written by myself with
significant input from Prof.~Runciman.  The first paper contributes to
\cref{chp:dejafu}, the second to \cref{chp:coco}.  In addition, an
updated version of the \dejafu{} paper was published as a departmental
technical report:

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item Michael Walker. \dejafu{}: A Concurrency Testing Library for
  Haskell.  Technical report, University of York, Department of
  Computer Science, 2016.\nocite{YCS-2016-503}
\end{enumerate}

Furthermore, the inspiration for the investigation in
\cref{chp:algorithms} arose from discussions with Dr.~Alistair
Donaldson and the now-Dr.~Paul Thomson\footnote{Both at Imperial
  College London}.
