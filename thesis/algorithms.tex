\chapstart Not all algorithms are created equal.
When we impose bounds on schedules explored, we accept that we may not find \emph{all} buggy
executions.  However we do want to find \emph{most of them}.  In this chapter we discuss a number of
algorithms (\S\ref{sec:algorithms-usual}), propose a new one based on a \emph{weighted} random
selection of threads (\S\ref{sec:algorithms-swarm}), and show that it performs favourably in a
comparison of standard benchmark programs (\S\ref{sec:algorithms-sctbench}).
