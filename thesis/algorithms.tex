\chapstart When we impose schedule bounds for testing, we may not find
\emph{all} buggy executions.  However we still want to find \emph{most of them}.
Benchmarks show that some algorithms tend to be better at this than others; not
all algorithms are created equal.  In this chapter we discuss a number of
algorithms~\sref{algorithms-usual}, propose a new one based on a \emph{weighted}
random selection of threads~\sref{algorithms-swarm}, and show that it performs
favourably in a comparison of standard benchmark
programs~\sref{algorithms-sctbench}.
