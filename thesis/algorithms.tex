\chapstart Not all algorithms are created equal.
When we impose bounds on schedules explored, we accept that we may not find \emph{all} buggy
executions.  However we do want to find \emph{most of them}.  In this chapter we discuss a number of
algorithms~\sref{algorithms-usual}, propose a new one based on a \emph{weighted} random selection of
threads~\sref{algorithms-swarm}, and show that it performs favourably in a comparison of standard
benchmark programs~\sref{algorithms-sctbench}.
