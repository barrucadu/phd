The complete-within-a-bound approach of DPOR may not be feasible in large
programs.  We can sacrifice completeness, and instead explore the space of
schedules \emph{randomly}.  We may not find all bugs.  However we still want to
find \emph{most of them}.  Benchmarks show that some scheduling algorithms tend
to be better at this than others; not all algorithms are created equal.  In this
chapter we discuss a number of scheduling algorithms~\sref{algorithms-usual},
propose a new one based on a \emph{weighted} random selection of
threads~\sref{algorithms-swarm}, and show that it performs favourably in a
comparison of standard benchmark programs~\sref{algorithms-sctbench}.
