A common approach to testing in Haskell is to give properties about the code.
Property-testing tools are used to generate input values, and check that these
properties hold.  The popularity of property-testing stems from the difficulty
of writing good tests.  Much better to let something else, such as a tool, worry
about which cases to test.  In this chapter we give an overview of using
property-testing tools.

Readers already familiar with property-testing may wish to skip this chapter.
