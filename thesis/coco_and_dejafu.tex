\chapstart Properties are tests as well as behavioural specifications and
documentation.  Regression testing ensures that behavioural changes in a program
or library are noticed.  Properties discovered by a tool can serve as simple
regression tests.  In this chapter we show the bridge between CoCo and
\dejafu{}, allowing properties that CoCo finds to be added to a \dejafu{}
testsuite.
