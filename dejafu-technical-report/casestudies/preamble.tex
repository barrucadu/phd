Three case studies are discussed, two of which are from pre-existing
libraries which have been modified to use the \verb|MonadConc|
abstraction. Two known bugs are reproduced in the
\emph{auto-update}\footnote{\hackage{auto-update}} library. Then,
there is a bug which arose unintentionally in the implementation of a
library for expressing parallel search problems, where an incorrect
use of \verb|CTMVar|s allowed a user to observe a partial
result. Finally, one of the schedulers in the
\emph{monad-par}\footnote{\hackage{monad-par}} is tested.
