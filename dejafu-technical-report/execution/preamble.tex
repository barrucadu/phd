This chapter describes the test execution of a concurrent program
written using the \verb|MonadConc| abstraction, not the execution of
programs using GHC's actual concurrency primitives. Of course, for
correctness of testing, there should be a correspondence between these
two models, see \chap{correctness}.

The execution of a concurrent program is considered to be the
sequential stepwise execution of \emph{primitive actions}, the most
basic things that a computation can do.
