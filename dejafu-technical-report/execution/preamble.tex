This chapter describes the execution of a concurrent program written
using the \verb|MonadConc| abstraction under test, not the execution
of programs using GHC's actual concurrency primitives. Of course, for
correctness of testing, there should be a correspondence between these
two models, which is discussed in \chap{correctness}.

The execution of a concurrent program is considered to be the
sequential stepwise execution of \emph{primitive actions}, the most
basic things that a computation can do.
