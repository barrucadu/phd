A talk about \dejafu{} was given at the 2015 Haskell Symposium. The
response was generally positive and the relaxed memory work was
initiated following discussions about how to integrate \dejafu{} with
libraries like \emph{monad-par}\footnote{\hackage{monad-par}} and
\emph{lvish}\footnote{\hackage{lvish}}.

Whilst no packages use \dejafu{} yet, the released version is quite
primitive compared to the current developmental version, and it is
hoped that the next release (and announcement) will inspire some
interest.
