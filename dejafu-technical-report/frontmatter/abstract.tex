Out of work in the formal verification and model checking field has
grown the topic of \emph{systematic concurrency testing} (SCT), also
known as \emph{stateless model checking}. This technique allows the
reliable, deterministic, and rigorous testing of concurrent programs,
and has enjoyed some success in the imperative and object-oriented
settings. We propose that the functional world could also benefit from
systematic concurrency testing, as GHC Haskell in particular provides
a very rich set of concurrency primitives.

We have developed a library for writing testable concurrent Haskell
programs, using a typeclass-abstraction to select based on the context
of use the concrete implementation to use: the runtime-provided
primitives, or emulated versions provided as part of a testing
framework.

This report discusses the design and implementation of this library,
called \dejafu{}, including some case studies and the community
reception of the initial version presented at the 2015 Haskell
Symposium.
