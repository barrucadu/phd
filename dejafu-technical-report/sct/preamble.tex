Once the scheduling behaviour of a program can be directed at will,
the next step is \emph{systematic} testing of programs for a carefully
chosen variety of schedules. Systematic concurrency testing (SCT)
comprises a family of techniques, all with the same general aim: to
try to find bugs in concurrent programs, more reliably than running a
program several times. Within this scope, some techniques are
\emph{complete}, in that they find all possible results a program
could produce; others are \emph{incomplete}, as there is no such
guarantee.

SCT works by providing an initial sequence of scheduling decisions
intended to put the program into a new internal state. After this
point some deterministic scheduler is used, and the final trace is
examined to produce new initial sequences. Typically the assumption is
made that all executions are \emph{terminating}: all possible
sequences of scheduling decisions will lead to a termination by
deadlock or otherwise. Another common assumption is that there is a
\emph{finite} number of possible schedules: this forbids finite but
arbitrarily long executions, as can be created with constructs such as
spinlocks.

Systematic testing terminates when there are no further distinct
initial sequences possible.
