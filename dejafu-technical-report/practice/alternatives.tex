There are popular Haskell libraries specifically for concurrency. One
of these is the \emph{async}\footnote{\hackage{async}} library, for
expressing asynchronous computations. This library is intended to be a
higher-level and safer way of expressing asynchronous computations
than using \verb|forkIO| and \verb|MVar|s directly. It provides two
main functions to execute an action asynchronously:

\begin{haskellcode}
async :: IO a -> IO (Async a)
withAsync :: IO a -> (Async a -> IO b) -> IO b
\end{haskellcode}

Both of these fork the computation into a separate thread, returning
an \verb|Async| value, which contains an \verb|MVar| which can be
blocked on in order to retrieve the result. In addition,
\verb|withAsync| kills the thread if the inner action completes before
it, to help prevent resource leaks.

There is a further abstraction atop \verb|Async|, called
\verb|Concurrently|, which has Functor, Applicative, and Alternative
instances, and represents an action which can be composed with other
actions and execute concurrently. The concurrency is achieved by
having \verb|(<*>)| execute each action asynchronously. There was a
Monad instance proposed for \verb|Concurrently|, but this broke the
laws, as \verb|ap| was not the same as
\verb|(<*>)|\footnote{\url{https://github.com/simonmar/async/pull/26}}. This
was due to \verb|ap| executing its arguments sequentially, the only
option with \verb|(>>=)|.

This law-breaking could have been discovered through testing, but only
probabilistically. If \emph{async} were written using
\verb|MonadConc|, the relevant laws could have been specified as unit
tests and checked. The bug might then have been caught before it
showed up in user code.

To address both of these issues, there is an \emph{async-dejafu}
package, which provides almost the same API as \emph{async}, but is
parameterised by a \verb|MonadConc|, giving functions like this:

\begin{haskellcode}
async :: MonadConc m => m a -> m (Async m a)
withAsync :: MonadConc m => m a -> (Async m a -> m b) -> m b
\end{haskellcode}

There is a test suite using \dejafu{}. The test suite for \emph{async}
just runs most tests a single time, although one of them is run 1000
times. Using \dejafu{} here to automatically seek out interesting
schedules is a much more principled approach then repetition and hope.

Not all of the features of \emph{async} are supported by
\emph{async-dejafu}: as \verb|MonadConc| does not support bound
threads, those functions that use them have been omitted.

Of course, \emph{async} is just one library, and providing an
alternative library people will have to switch to is far from
optimal. However, until library authors start to use \dejafu{} and
\verb|MonadConc| directly, such alternatives will be needed to answer
the question ``Why should I use this if I can't use it with all of my
familiar tools?''
