A tool is effectively useless if it is too difficult to use. The main
obstacle to the use of \dejafu{} is existing libraries which use
\verb|IO|; one cannot simply use \verb|liftIO| everywhere, without
almost certainly sacrificing completeness in all but trivial examples.

A second, more tractable, problem, is integration with existing
testing frameworks; using \dejafu{} for little stand-alone programs is
all well and good, but in order to take off, it must be easy to use in
the testing context people are already familiar with.
