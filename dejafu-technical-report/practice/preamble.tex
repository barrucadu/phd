A tool is effectively useless if it is too difficult to use. The main
obstacle to the use of \dejafu{} is existing libraries which use
\verb|IO|; one cannot simply use \verb|liftIO| everywhere, without
almost certainly sacrificing completeness in all but trivial
examples. Ideally, existing libraries would be modified to support the
\verb|MonadConc| abstraction. However, this does not seem a likely
short-term goal, and so a more promising way to approach the problem
is to provide feature-complete alternatives to existing libraries. As
adapting code to \verb|MonadConc| is not very difficult given the
ability to also modify the dependencies, as seen in the Par monad case
study, this is a viable short-term solution.

A second, more tractable, problem is integration with existing testing
frameworks; using \dejafu{} for little stand-alone programs is all
well and good, but in order to take off, it must be easy to use in the
testing context people are already familiar with.
