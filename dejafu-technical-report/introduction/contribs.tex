The primary contribution of this report is a library for testing
concurrent Haskell programs based on a somewhat novel algorithm for
reducing the number of schedules to test.

Our contributions can be seen as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Existing results from the concurrency testing world have been
  ported to functional programming, an area historically without much
  in this topic, and verified to apply.

\item A partial-order reduction algorithm for systematic concurrency
  testing based on a combination of two others: bounded partial-order
  reduction \cite{bpor} and relaxed-memory DPOR \cite{rdpor}.
\end{itemize}
