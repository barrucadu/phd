In order to be useful, a testing tool must be \emph{correct}. More
specifically, it needs to be:

\defineword{Sound}{%
  Every result which the testing functions report as possible can show
  up under actual execution.}

\defineword{Complete}{%
  The testing functions report as possible every result which can show
  up under actual execution.}

Nothing is missed, and nothing is made up. Comparing test results
against multiple actual results can give confidence in the correctness
of \dejafu{}, but the whole point of systematic concurrency testing is
to move \emph{away} from running things many times! In order to be
certain of correctness, a correspondence must be established,
formally, between the semantics of the true concurrency abstraction
and the testing implementation.

Establishing the correctness of \dejafu{} decomposes very naturally
into two parts: is the execution of a computation under a single
arbitrary schedule correct; and is the SCT implementation correct?
