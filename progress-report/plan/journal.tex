\dejafu{} has been developed substantially since \citep{dejafu}. The
published version is very slow and lacking in features in
comparison. A fuller and updated account is being prepared (see the
supporting document). In the short-term, I plan to continue improving
that document and submit it for consideration as an official
departmental technical report. The longer-term plan is to continue
improving the document and submit it to a journal for publication.

Perhaps the natural choice of venue is the Journal of Functional
Programming, as \dejafu{} is for testing concurrent \emph{Haskell}
programs, and is implemented in Haskell. But there may be other more
suitable ones, which must be investigated.
