The goal of my research is to develop and evaluate new conceptual
tools to enable programmers to make use of potentially
nondeterministic concurrency whilst being confident of the correctness
of their programs. An important aspect of this is that anything
developed scales to real-world programs, not just small
examples. Furthermore, whilst much of the work is being done in the
context of Haskell, results should also apply to other pure functional
languages.

There are a number of open directions for further work:

\begin{itemize}
\item Submitting a new and fuller account of \dejafu{} to a journal.

\item Automated generation of test cases for concurrent APIs.

\item Monitoring properties during execution of a concurrent program,
  rather than just examining the return value after termination.

\item Automated introduction of safe concurrency for simple cases.

\item Enforcement of concurrency safety properties through types.
\end{itemize}
