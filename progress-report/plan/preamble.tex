The goal of my research is to implement libraries and tools to enable
programmers to make use of potentially nondeterministic concurrency
whilst being confident of the correctness of their pro- grams. An
important aspect of this is that anything developed scales to
real-world programs, not just small examples. Furthermore, whilst much
of the work is being done in the context of Haskell, results should
also apply to other pure functional languages.

There are a number of open directions for further work:

\begin{itemize}
\item Submitting a new and fuller account of \dejafu{} to a journal.

\item Automated generation of test cases for concurrent APIs.

\item Monitoring properties during execution of a concurrent program,
  rather than just examining the return value after termination.

\item Automated introduction of safe concurrency for simple cases.
\end{itemize}
