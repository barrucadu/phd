The goal of my research is to develop and evaluate new conceptual
tools to enable programmers to make use of nondeterministic
concurrency with confidence in the correctness of their programs. A
desirable aspect of this is that tools developed scale to real-world
programs, not just small examples. Furthermore, although the work is
being done in the context of Haskell, results should also apply to
other pure functional languages.

The plans leading to the thesis are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Submitting a new and fuller account of \dejafu{} to a journal.

\item Automated generation of test cases for concurrent APIs.

\item Monitoring properties during execution of a concurrent program,
  rather than just examining the return value after termination.

\item Automated introduction of safe concurrency for simple cases.

\item Enforcement of concurrency safety properties through types.
\end{itemize}
