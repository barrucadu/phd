This interim report discusses developments and new research directions
since the qualifying dissertation. The scope of the work is improving
the ease of writing correct concurrent functional programs, and is
being done in the context of Haskell.

The \dejafu{} tool for testing concurrent Haskell programs has had
significant development: support for relaxed memory models; use of
partial-order reduction over schedule bounding; and more supported
operations.

Research directions for the future are identified. These are:
submitting a journal article detailing the updated \dejafu{} tool; LTL
property checking; the automated generation of properties of
concurrent programs, suitable for use as test cases; the automated
parallelisation of list comprehensions; and the encoding of safety
properties as types.
