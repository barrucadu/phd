This interim report discusses developments and new research directions
since the qualifying dissertation. The scope of the work is improving
the ease of writing correct concurrent functional programs, and is
being done in the context of Haskell.

The \dejafu{} tool for testing concurrent Haskell programs has had
significant development: support for relaxed memory models; use of
partial-order reduction over schedule bounding; and more supported
operations.

Research directions for the future are identified. These are:
furthering the \dejafu{} tool to support LTL property checking;
automatically generating properties of collections of concurrent
programs, suitable for use as test cases; automatically parallelising
list comprehensions, making it easier to use concurrency without
needing to implement it manually; and encoding safety properties, such
as deadlock freedom, in types.
