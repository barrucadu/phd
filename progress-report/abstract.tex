This interim report discusses developments and new research directions
since the qualifying dissertation. The scope of the work is
concurrency in functional programming languages, particularly Haskell.

The \dejafu{} tool for testing concurrent Haskell programs has had
significant development: support for relaxed memory models; use of
partial-order reduction over schedule bounding; and more supported
operations.

Research directions for the near future are identified, with
speculative suggestions for what further work will arise. These are:
submitting a journal article detailing the updated \dejafu{} tool; LTL
property checking; the automated generation of properties of
concurrent programs, suitable for use as test cases; and the automated
parallelisation of list comprehensions.
