In the qualifying dissertation, the plan was to spend the months
October 2015 to July 2016 producing a tool for verifying concurrent
programs written in a core functional language. This has not been
started.

Discussions following the presentation of \dejafu{} at the Haskell
Symposium suggested further work than what was originally
planned. This resulted in support for modelling computations with
relaxed memory effects, and new basic operations (see
\sect{progress-dejafu}). Implementation and experimentation work on
\dejafu{} continued until the end of November, whereas originally this
was estimated to finish by October.

Formal verification was then investigated, starting with the
formalisation of the core data structures and functions of
\dejafu{}. This was attempted in Isabelle. Unfortunately, due to the
complexity of the core data structure, this seemed to have limited
prospects of success, without significantly restructuring the
implementation. This took all of December.

Now the intent is to return the focus to the area of testing, rather
than verification.
